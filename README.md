# VBA-Scritps
This repo is a collection of scripts to automate commom MS Excel tasks.

The _Module-level-scripts_ folder provides such scripts in the form of sub procedures and functions, while the _Class-module-scripts_ folder provides support for those scripts (like speeding up code by manipulating the Excel Application [settings](https://github.com/jhormangj/VBA-Scripts/blob/master/Class-level-scripts/clsExcelSettings.cls)) or even further functionality to solve other problems.

Inside each script the comment __'MODIFY THIS__ is visual prompt for you to provide the necessary data to run the script. Also, before the sub procedure name you will find reference requirements. This requirements are all available via __Tools__ -> __References__ in the VBA editor. Check all that apply.

*Style* is based on [danwagnerco](https://github.com/danwagnerco/vba-style-guide) and [spences10](https://github.com/spences10/VBA-Coding-Standards) contributions.

# VBA-Scritps
VBA subs and functions for general problems.

These scripts should serve as a route to learn python, to switch from VBA to Python, by solving common Excel tasks.

Style based on [danwagnerco](https://github.com/danwagnerco/vba-style-guide). I'm not using Hungarian Notion, though, as noted in Chapter 1 of Clean Code by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob).

# VBA-Scritps
This repo is a collection of scripts to automate commom MS Excel tasks. THe folder structure is as follows:

* The _Module-level-scripts_ folder provides such scripts in the form of sub procedures and functions
* The _Class-module-scripts_ folder provides support for those scripts (like speeding up code by manipulating the Excel Application [settings](https://github.com/jhormangj/VBA-Scripts/blob/master/Class-level-scripts/clsExcelSettings.cls)) or even further functionality to solve other problems.
* The _Personal-workbook_ folder provides scripts I recommend to add to your *PERSONAL.XLSB* to use in every day tasks.
* The _Add-ins_ folder is for *.xlam* Add-ins like user defined functions, to leverage you Excel functions library.

Inside some scripts the comment __'MODIFY THIS__ is a visual prompt for you to provide the necessary data to run the script. Also, before the sub procedure name you will find reference requirements. This requirements are all available via __Tools__ -> __References__ in the VBA editor. Check all that apply.

*Style* is based on [danwagnerco](https://github.com/danwagnerco/vba-style-guide) and [spences10](https://github.com/spences10/VBA-Coding-Standards) contributions.
